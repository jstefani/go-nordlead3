# go-nordlead3
Nord Lead 3 Sysex Parser Library in Go (Golang). Work in Progress.

## Kicking the tires

For a quick spin through it, grab a sysex file or saved dump from your NL3 and run:

`go run nl3edit.go <path to your sysex file>`

It'll popup a little menu-driven console editor interface to the file data, letting you do fun things like view, export, rename, move, and other stuff.
